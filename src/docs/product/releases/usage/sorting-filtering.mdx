<Note>

This feature is available only if you're in the Early Adopter program. Features available to Early Adopters are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony. If you’re interested in being an Early Adopter, you can turn your organization’s Early Adopter status on/off in General Settings. This will affect all users in your organization and can be turned back off just as easily.

</Note>

## Sorting Releases

On Releases list, use "Sort By" dropdown in the top right to sort releases by:
- Date Created
- Total Sessions
- [Active Sessions/Users](/product/releases/health/#active-sessionsusers)
- [Crash Free Sessions/Users](/product/releases/health/#crash-free-sessionsusers)
- Build Number
- Semantic Version

## Filtering Releases

Search on [Releases](/product/releases/) page supports both raw text and query syntax. If you are using our [Semantic Versioning](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/releases/#bind-the-version) format, following query tokens are known to Sentry:

- `release` - search based on string comparison
- `release.package` - search releases with matching package names
- `release.version` - search releases with matching semantic version. Supports ranges and wildcards (e.g. `release.version:>7.8` or `release.version:1.2.*`)
- `release.build` - search releases with matching build numbers

For more information on search queries, see [Search](/product/sentry-basics/search/).
